# NAME

**bashd** - Bash language server

# SYNOPSIS

bashd [_OPTIONS_]

# DESCRIPTION

bashd is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Bash, built using
the Go sh package and featuring ShellCheck integration for real-time linting.

# OPTIONS

---

- **-j**, **--json**
  Log in JSON format.

- **-l**, **--logfile** _FILE_
  Log to _FILE_ instead of stderr.

- **-v**, **--verbose**
  Increase log message verbosity with repeated usage up to **-vvv**.

- **-S**, **--severity** _SEVERITY-LEVEL_
  Minimum severity used for diagnostics. _SEVERITY_LEVEL_ must be one of
  _style_, _info_, _warning_ or _error_. Default: _style_

- **--shellcheck-enable** _OPTIONAL-LINTS_
  Enable **shellcheck** optional lints. See avaible optional lints with
  **shellcheck --list-optional**.

- **--shellcheck-exclude** _RULE-CODES_
  Exclude **shellcheck** lints. _RULES-COES_ is a comma separated list of rules.

- **--shellcheck-include** _RULE-CODES_
  Only include **shellcheck** lints. _RULES-CODES_ is a comma separated list of
  rules. All other rules will be disabled.

- **--fmt-binary-next-line**
  On format, binary operators will appear on the next line when a binary command,
  such as a **|**, **&&** or **||**, spans multiple lines. A **`\\`** will be
  used.


- **--fmt-case-indent**
  On format, **switch** cases will be indented. As such, **switch** case bodies
  will be two levels deeper than the **switch** itself.


- **--fmt-func-next-line**
  On format, function opening braces are placed on a separate line.

- **--fmt-space-redirects**
  On format, redirect operators such as **>** will be followed by a space.

- **-h**, **--help**
  Print a help message.

- **-V**, **--version**
  Print the version.

# CONFIGURATION
## severity
Minimum severity used for diagnostics. Must be one of
_style_, _info_, _warning_ or _error_. Default: _style_

## shellcheck
---
- **include**
  List of **shellcheck** rule codes. All other rules will be disabled.

- **exclude**
  List of **shellcheck** rules codes.

- **enable**
  List of **shellcheck** optional lints.

As the time of writing the following optional lints are available:

| Rule name                    | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _add-default-case_           | Suggest adding a default case in **case** statements            |
| _avoid-negated-conditions_   | Suggest removing unnecessary comparison negations               |
| _avoid-nullary-conditions_   | Suggest explicitly using **-n** in **[ $var ]**                 |
| _check-extra-masked-returns_ | Check for additional cases where exit codes are masked          |
| _check-set-e-suppressed_     | Notify when **set -e** is suppressed during function invocation |
| _check-unassigned-uppercase_ | Warn when uppercase variables are unassigned                    |
| _deprecate-which_            | Suggest **command -v** instead of **which**                     |
| _quote-safe-variables_       | Suggest quoting variables without metacharacters                |
| _require-double-brackets_    | Require **[[** and warn about **[** in Bash/Ksh                 |
| _require-variable-braces_    | Suggest putting braces around all variable references           |
| _useless-use-of-cat_         | Check for Useless Use Of Cat (UUOC)                             |


## format
---
- **binary_next_line**
  Binary operators will appear on the next line when a binary
  command, such as a **|**, **&&** or **||**, spans multiple lines. A **`\\`**
  will be used between lines.

- **case_indent**
  Switch cases will be indented. As such, **switch** case bodies will
  be two levels deeper than the **switch** itself.

- **space_redirects**
  Redirect operators such as **>** will be followed by a space.

- **func_next_line**
  Function opening braces are placed on a separate line.

# EXAMPLES
## Invoke with highest log level and log to a file

```sh
bashd -vvv --logfile <LOG-FILE-NAME>
```

To do the same within Neovim, use
```lua
    vim.lsp.config.bashd = {
      cmd = { "bashd", "-vvv", "--logfile", "<LOG-FILE-NAME>" },
      -- ...
```

or in Helix via

```toml
    [language-server.bashd]
    command = "bashd"
    args = [ "-vvv", "--logfile", "<LOG_FILE-NAME>"]
    # ...
```


## Neovim configuration
```lua
vim.lsp.config.bashd = {
  cmd = { "bashd" },

        include = {},                    -- Consider only given types of warnings
        exclude = {},                    -- Exclude types of warnings
        enable = {                       -- List of optional checks to enable (or 'all')
          "add-default-case",            -- Suggest adding a default case in `case` statements

      }
    }
  }
